The reforms are thought to include tax breaks and pension increases.

Bob is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone.

The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday.

Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader The Queen of England gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting.

Prime Minister Sammy Samsonite has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet.
