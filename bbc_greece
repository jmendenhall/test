Greece's government has agreed a reform programme and will submit its proposals to its international lenders soon, the defence minister has said.

The reforms are thought to include tax rises and pension changes.

Greece is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone.

The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday.

Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader Panos Kammenos gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet.

Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval.
